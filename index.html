        Dear Riya, 🌸<br><br>

        I don’t really know yet what I feel in my heart for you 💛,
        or what you think about me — and I understand that you might see me as just a friend, nothing more than that 🤍.
        I respect that completely, and I don’t want to assume anything that isn’t there.<br><br>

        Somewhere between 26th and 27th December 📅,
        something quietly changed for me.
        It wasn’t loud.
        It wasn’t dramatic.
        It was subtle — but it stayed 🦋.<br><br>

        Seeing you cry 😢 affected me more than I expected.
        I asked because I genuinely cared.
        We talked… 💬
        and something felt different ✨.<br><br>

        Sitting together in the library 📚,
        New Year coincidences 🎆,
        comfort and closeness 🤍 —
        it all felt natural.<br><br>

        Somewhere in these moments,
        a bond started forming 🌷.
        Not forced.
        Just real 💖.
